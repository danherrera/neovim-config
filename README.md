## Use this config

If the `~/.config/nvim` directory doesn't exist, clone this repo into `~/.config` and rename the newly added directory from `neovim-config` to `nvim`. Test nvim out. The first time will read in the configurations.

Alternatively, the repo may be cloned elsewhere and the contents of the directory moved to ~/.config/nvim/`.
